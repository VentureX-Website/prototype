                <p>Being an entrepreneur, although rewarding, isn’t always the easiest path to choose and
                    perhaps that is what makes it all the more worthwhile. Success is not built on success; it is
                    built on failure and frustration. No one gets an incredible idea and then magically grows it
                    into a successful business overnight without facing some mishaps. It takes a lot of grit and
                    strength even just to keep going sometimes. Being stuck in this funk happens to the best of
                    us; not just in our professional lives, but personally too. One way to go about it is to saturate
                    yourself with anything and everything ‘motivational’ out there. A lot of entrepreneurs and
                    other highly successful people recommend boosting morale by adopting certain techniques
                    and strategies designed for the very same. There is a lot of motivational content out there
                    and it is a very deep hole to dive into, but here’s a quick guide to get you back to being
                    productive in no time and to save you the 100 hours that I now wish I could save too.
                </p>


                <p>Whilst reading books and watching videos, the one
                    thing that was emphasised over and over again was
                    the power of Habit. Each day, we make small
                    decisions and carry out actions that form our habits.
                    The tiniest changes in our habits change the ambit
                    of our lives in very subtle ways. You are your habits.
                    We convince ourselves that success is the outcome
                    of massive actions, but that isn’t always the case. It
                    is often the tiniest of movements that create
                    impressive change. By doing 1% better every day,
                    you are becoming nearly 38 times better at the end of the year as told by James Clear in the
                    book ‘Atomic Habits’. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a
                    habit.
                    
                </p> <br>

                <div class="container"><img src="../assets/img/blogs/5/1.jpg"  class="img-fluid bpic" alt="" ></div> <br>
                
                <p>The environment shapes human behaviour in an invisible way. Our habits are thought of as
                    the outcomes of motivation, talent, and effort. No doubt, these factors are important, but
                    it's surprising how much your personal characteristics get influenced by your environment,
                    especially over a long period of time. You should operate in a setting that fuels your results
                    instead of hindering them, if you want to maximize your chances of success. Surround
                    yourself with people who inspire you to be better each day. Make sure that what you are
                    working towards is something you like, working hard towards something you don’t care
                    about is basically what the definition of stress is. Many people think that they lack
                    motivation when what they really lack is clarity. Taking some time to re-evaluate and reset
                    your goals is sometimes necessary.</p> <br>

                 <p>Here is a personally curated list of all things inspiring to help you get through a slump and
                    gain some inspiration and ideas to follow through on your ideas:</p>
