                <p>
                    You might have seen the news about a set of 107 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing
                    images of the cartoon ‘Bored Apes’ sold for $24.4 million in an online sale at Sotheby’s auction
                    house on Thursday. This got me thinking and I wanted to understand what’s going on with these
                    NFTs, so I spent the weekend doing some research.    
                </p>

               <h3>Well, what are NFTs?</h3>
               <p>NFTs are Non-Fungible Tokens. The abbreviation by itself doesn’t make much sense to a
                layman. Investopedia tells us that </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p style="font-size:1rem;">
                    “Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be readily
                    interchanged for another of like kind. Money is a prime example of something fungible, where a
                    $1 bill is easily convertible into four quarters or ten dimes, etc.”
                             
                </p>
                </blockquote>
               <p>
                Non-Fungible entities are unique and can’t be replaced with something else. Entities like a
                house or a painting like Mona Lisa are non-fungible. You can take a sketch or buy a print but
                there will only be one OG Mona Lisa Painting.    
              </p>
              <p>NFTs are "one-of-a-kind" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold like any other
                piece of property, but they have no tangible form of their own. NFTs are supposed to be
                “Non-Fungible” and thus you can’t use these tokens for commercial transactions as they are all
                unique, whereas fungible tokens like cryptocurrency can be used for transactions as they are
                identical to one another.</p>
              <h3>How do they work?</h3>
              <p>It’s common knowledge that digital files can be easily duplicated. What if you could assign a
                unique “token” to one digital file to distinguish it and what if this “token” could be bought/sold?
                This token will be unique and will vary from NFT to NFT. So upon ownership of this “token”, it’s
                like you own the original digital file.</p>
                <br> 
              <div class="container"><img src="../assets/img/blogs/2/1.jpg"  class="img-fluid bpic" alt="" >
               </div>
               <br>
               <p>The above Nyan Cat artwork was sold for $590,000.</p>
               <p><b>“I can just download the Nyan Cat artwork and use it for stuff, why would I buy it?”</b></p>
               <p>Yes, you can. But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied i.e. ownership
                of the work. It’s somewhat like owning the original Mona Lisa Painting and looking down at
                people with the copies (no offence, but the flex though).</p>
                <p>They are a part of the Ethereum Blockchain. These blockchains serve as a digital ledger that is
                    maintained by thousands of computers around the world. Euromoney tells us that “Blockchain is
                    a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack,
                    or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated
                    and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.”
                    Basically, we can say that there’s no risk of your NFT being “stolen” or even “duplicated” in its
                    true sense.</p>
                <p>It’s also worth mentioning that NFTs can also contain smart contracts that may give the
                    artist(creator of the digital file), for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</p>
               <blockquote>
                <p style="font-size:1rem;">
                  “Never feel shame for trying and failing for he who has never failed is he who has never tried.”
                    </blockquote>
