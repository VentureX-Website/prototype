                <p>In the world of entrepreneurs, creating ideas, working on them, and finding possible markets are absolute needs. And, to facilitate 
                    these, we need a set of unparalleled experiences. And hopefully, these needs can be fulfilled on the internet. Owing to the pandemic
                     and other recent developments, it is highly recommended as the best move to go through these online courses and perfect your knowledge 
                     and doability. Although most people would give their thoughts that the certificates through these courses don’t amount to your resume,
                      we are not looking for a standard-sized beautiful resume. We are talking about skills and advice which can be acquired through these courses.
                </p>
                <p>Among many of the sites available, Coursera has been listed here multiple times. And, the powerful nature of Coursera is that we can apply for
                     financial aid and get the courses (with certificates) mostly free of cost. Most of the courses found in EdX are a bit expensive but it too 
                     has an option of financial aid application which avails the course at 90% free and a certificate of completion. Udemy does not provide financial aid.
                      However, they provide a lot of discounts all around the year. Top institutes like Harvard, Stanford, Yale, MIT, and others provide free courses 
                      (limited time enrolments) and paid courses with certificates of completion.
                </p>
                <p>The idea is to access good stuff with the least prices. Almost all the courses listed on the blog can be acquired free and the medium is all in
                     English. Note that the serial is random and not in order of value. The reader determines the value on his/her own. Websites to access the courses have
                      also been provided.
                </p>

                        This course mainly focuses on the innovative aspect of entrepreneurship rather than the latter part of the startup 
                        which is building it up from scratch. Every business/start-up consists of idea formation and idea execution. 
                        Both are equally important but so, the idea formation is often left out and the seven coursed specialization 
                        can give a glimpse of idea-making.

                     <p>
                        Over the course, students will be provided with a deep understanding of the mechanism underpinning the creation and/or development of
                         a firm and the financial support it can get from the financial system through venture capital investment.
                        The course tries to discover how special financial intermediaries (called private equity investors) finance through equity companies
                         belonging to different stages of their life-cycle, starting from the very beginning (startup and early-stage) to a more mature
                          phase (i.e. expansion, mature age, etc.) or also staying into crises and decline.

                            “Private equity (named venture capital when the company is in the first phases of its life cycle) deals with very different activities,
                             such as scouting, advisory, deal-making, valuation, and financing as financial intermediaries see it.”

                             be accountable through weekly updates. If you are thinking of starting a startup in the future, then there is the ‘Aspiring founders track’

                                 The initiative inspired a number of other institutions to make their course materials available as open educational resources.

                            Simply put, the site presents the core academic content — including lecture notes, syllabi, assignments, and exams — from nearly
                             all of MIT's undergraduate and graduate curriculum. All content is offered freely and openly to support formal and informal learning
                              around the world, whenever learners need them. 
                            </p> 

                         <p>The course is divided into ‘core’ and ‘supplementary’: Core courses, the starting points for entrepreneurs, and Supplemental courses,
                              important once the basics have been mastered. Packed with textbooks, videos, and other materials, it is a complete course on entrepreneurship
                               which of course won’t be favorable to students with a lack of reading mentality. The resource is so vast that you must have to go through 
                               multiple tabs to access the materials. However, some briefs about the course are to overcome top myths and get biased into facts, define
                                goals, market research, choosing the right customers and right business opportunity.
